REGEX
  Find something at end of string
    something$
  Find at start of string
    ^something
UTF - 8
  Uses one to four bits for each of 130,000+ characters in many world scripts
  
Tokenization
  Finds tokens- words or sentences- but some non-words like "n't" are used as tokens to identify negation.
  nltk.word_tokenize
  nltk.sent_tokeinze
Lemmatization vs. Stemming
What is the difference?
  Lemmatization leaves stems that are valid words! Useful...
  PorterStemmer(t) = stems on each token

POS Tag
  "Part of Speech" Tag
  nltk.pos_tag(text)
  
CFG Grammar in NLTk
grammar1 = nltk.data.load('mygrammar.cfg')
  create and save 'mygrammar.cfg' like this:
    S -> NP VP
    VP -> V NP
    NP -> "James" | "Audrey"
    V -> "loves"
Use Machine-Learned treebank
  from nltk.corpus import treebank

CLASSIFICATION
Training Phase Questions
  1. What are the features and how to represent them?
    - Normalization (make all lowercase)
    - Stop words (ignore "the" "a" etc)
    - Stem/Lemmatize (reduce to root essence, eliminating plurals, tenses)
    - Parts of Speech (can give context clues to mispelled words, or meanings)
    - Synonyms (can be compressed into one feature)
    - Ngrams consider set of words as one meaning
  2. What algorithm to use?
  3. Which parameters tuned on algorithm?
Test Phase
  1. How to measure good performance?

CountVectorizer >> CountVectorizer.fit(X_train)
  Makes term-document matrix
  TFIDF >> TfidfVectorizer(min_df = <min appearances threshold>).fit(X_train)
    measure of term importance
    In information retrieval, tf–idf, short for term frequency–inverse document frequency, is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus.[1]
  N-Grams capture small phrases  >> CountVectorizer(ngram_range=(1,2,<etc..>).fit(X_train)
    ex: "not good" vs. "good"

SEMANTICS
Distributional Similarity
  Words that often appear with a common third word are likely related
  Pointwise Mutual Information
    Like tfidf, reduces weight of very common words
    PMI(w,c) = log[P(w,c)/P(w)P(c)]
    
Latend Distribution Modeling
  1. Topics have distributions of words
  2. Topics are mixed together by some mixing distribution
  3. Words are drawn to generate a corpus of text
  - Could maybe learn word distribution of different religions 
    and guess the religion based on some scripture text?
 Hypernym is a superset of hyponym, which is a subet
  ex: dog is hyponym of puppy
 Person/Organization/Location/Other 
  Standard 4-class "named entity" classification
